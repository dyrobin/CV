I built a small full IP network to make different radio-type devices communicate directly. The scenario worked like this: if a Zigbee motion detector finds people moving then another Zigbee light is switched on and a WiFi camera starts to work. The scenario itself is simple but the amazing part is that no gateway was used to connect them. Instead, every device had its own auto-configured IP address and was able to be controlled by any device on the Internet, for example, a laptop, a cell phone or even an application server. The controlling protocol is CoAP, an HTTP-like protocol specially designed for future IoT. Comparing to traditional gateway, full IP network will decrease the system complexity greatly as it doesnâ€™t need to maintain different stacks for different radios. This prototyped network is actually an extension of 6LoWPAN and as Bluetooth SIG declare that IP will be supported in their future I believe full IP network will become the mainstream connectivity solution.
